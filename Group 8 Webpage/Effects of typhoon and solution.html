 			<h3>Typhoon Frank</h3> 
	<p1>Typhoon Frank (Fengshen) struck the Philippines in 2008, causing 3.6 million people to be affected throughout the provinces. The Visayas, Mindanao, and most of the country's central region were the hardest hit, with over 300,000 homes, farms, and livestock destroyed. The Philippines will probably continue to be at danger for flooding, which could become more frequent and severe as a result of climate change. Frequent and destructive typhoons strike the Philippines, an archipelago in the Pacific Typhoon Belt, causing extensive damage to people, infrastructure, and agriculture, with losses estimated at billions of pesos. 
	Although typhoons typically have negative effects on locations, they have been known to restore water supplies and enhance water security in drought-affected areas. They can also temporarily alleviate high heat by bringing cooler temperatures to heat-wave-affected areas.
	Lucena's community prepared for Typhoon Frank by fortifying their homes and evacuating vulnerable members. With government support, they recovered, but they still faced long-term issues in repairing damaged infrastructure and guaranteeing food security.</p1>

	<div id="Preparedness">
	<h1>Why is it important to always be prepared for disasters?</h1>
	 <p2>Being prepared for disasters is assential because it minimizes the possible harm that can be brought on by unexpected incidents, maintaining property and saving lives.

	 <div id="Mitigation">
<h1>How can we mitigate the possible effects of typhoon?</h1>
	<p><b>Check the house for any weak spots:</b></p>
	<p>Inspect your home for any damage that could weaken its resilience to disasters. Residents of flood-prone ares should secure loose items outside, such as outdoor furniture and antennas, as they might turn into projectiles during strong winds. Have storm shutters installed over each window. By protecting windows from rain and strong winds, it can prevent damage and flooding.</p>
	</div>

	<p><b>Make disaster drills and practice them:</b></p>
	<p>We are able to understand what to do in a situation of a crisis by practicing for drills.Together with your family, decide what to do in a situation when local water levels begin to increase. Choose a meeting spot, choose ways to evacuate, and have a way of   communication. Make sure everyone is aware of what to do in case of an emergency. 
	</p>

	<p><b>Prepare your "Go bag":</b></p>
	<p>To temporarily sustain ourselves with, your "Go Bag" should include bottled water, non-perishable food like canned goods, hygiene items (toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, wet wipes), a flashlight, hand-crank or battery-operated AM/FM radio, extra batteries, emergency tools, mosquito repellent, a first aid kit, any necessary medications, and a change of clothes and footwear, and most crucial is to secure important documents. Make sure that your “Go bag” is protected from water to avoid damage.</p>

	<p><b>Look for a safe place:</b></p>
	 <p>In a typhoon, it's normally advisable to seek lower ground but, if there is flooding, move to higher ground.If evacuation is not required, locate a safe spot in your house.Stay clear of areas prone to flooding or landslides. Avoid areas with flying debris or dangerous objects, and, if possible, cancel all travel and outdoor activities until conditions stabilize. </p>

	 <p><b>Stay informed: </b></p>
	<p> Monitor weather forcasts and updates from reliable sources like PAGASA and the NDRRMC.And when a warning turns yellow, consider staying indoors or preparing to evacuate if water tends to rise in your area. Once warnings are orange, local authorities may activate evacuation procedures.</p>
